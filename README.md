### Roadmap
- [ ] Scroll to correct line in file when jumping from list view
- [ ] (Re)schedule TODOs from the list view
- [ ] Persist cache, on reopening only reindex files changed since Obsidian was closed
- [ ] Filter items list view by tags / freeform search
- [ ] Improve UI and themeability
- [ ] Integrate with daily notes plugin to ensure unscheduled TODOs in a daily note are listed in "Today"
